    "**Q1** I think that bias in algorithms is a reflection of human society. Algorithms are created by humans and operate because of humans, its source stems from humans. Whether intentional or not, bias in algorithms reveal human biases, like a bias against race or a certain type of cuisine. A positive of using algorithms is that it makes it a lot of things more convenient, like personalizing ads to help people find what they are looking for. A negative of using algorithms is that it cannot take every possible factor into account when making predictions. Algorithms and models are simplified math predictions, while our human reality is very complex and complicated. We shouldn't rely on just numbers when our reality is much more than that."

Another important thing is understanding where I am getting data from and how it was collected.

I could also ask the person if there was a better way to answer the question, and maybe suggest an alternative way that I would approach if I were trying to answer the question. I could point out how the bias is misleading and ask them if that is the picture they are trying to illustrate with their visualization."

    "Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil dives into how big data models are re-shaping our human society and even negatively impacting human lives. She begins the book by explaining how models produce predictions that can be helpful, like MLB models that are designed to help teams win the World Series or even mental models that help people decide what to cook for their family. However, even these models are never completely accurate because they don't take anything into account. There is always room for error. O'Neil then dives deeper into larger systems that rely on models, like the U.S. college education system and the criminal justice system. Systems like theses shouldn't allow for much room for error since they have significant impact on people's lives. However, because they utilize models and algorithms, large systems like these have a great influence in the way the systems operate, how people respond and try to \"beat the system,\" and even shape society's values.\n",
